## Description

This repo is a collection of remotes for [Unified Remote](https://www.unifiedremote.com/) that I crafted and use personally.

On Linux, these are supposed to go to:

```$HOME/.urserver/remotes/custom/```

## List

Currently it contains:

- **PulseAudio Volume** - a plugin for controlling volume level in any Linux system using PulseAudio
